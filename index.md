### What is Duckietown?
Duckietown (duckietown.org) is an open source platform used for teaching and research purposes for autonomous vehicles and robotics in more than 90 universities around the world. The Duckietown project started at MIT in 2016, with the scope of making robotics classes more practical, more interactive, and accessible to everyone. Duckietown is a small-scale environment composed of roads, intersections, street markings, and of course, “Duckiebot” robots which drive around in a complex multi-agent system.
